## Dynamic Dispatch

* The process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation (method or function) to call at runtime.
* Dynamic dispatch contrasts with static dispatch in which the implementation of a polymorphic operation is selected at compile-time.
* The purpose of dynamic dispatch is to support cases where the appropriate implementation of a polymorphic operation can't be determined at compile time because it depends on the runtime type of one or more actual parameters to the operation.

## Protocols

* In object-oriented programming, a **protocol or interface** is a common means for unrelated objects to communicate with each other. These are definitions of methods and values which the objects agree upon in order to cooperate.

[Wikipedia: Protocol (Object-Oriented Programming)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(object-oriented_programming))

* A **routing protocol** specifies how routers communicate with each other, disseminating information that enables them to select routes between any two nodes on a computer network.

## NoSQL

* A NoSQL or **Not Only SQL** database is a non-relational database. Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling and finer control over availability.
* Examples of NoSQL data structures include key-value, graph, or document. Depending on the problem, some operations are faster in NoSQL than in a relational database.

## Heap Memory

* The portion of memory where dynamically allocated memory resides (i.e. memory allocated via [malloc](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1213403/what-is-malloc-doing-in-this-code)).
* Memory allocated from the heap will remain allocated until one of the following occurs:
	* The memory is free'd
	* The program terminates

## Prototype-Based Programming

* A style of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes.

## Law of Demeter (LoD)

* The Law of Demeter (LoD) or **principle of least knowledge** is a design guideline for developing software, particularly object-oriented programs. It can be succinctly summarized by the following: *Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.*
* The fundamental notion is that a given object should assume as little as possible about the structure or properties of anything else (including its subcomponents), in accordance with the principle of ["information hiding"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding).

## Kleene Plus (the plus sign)

* In regular expressions, the Kleene Plus (+) means "in any length, larger than zero."

## Node

* In general, a node is a **device or data point on a larger network**. On the internet, a node is anything with an IP address. In reference to data structures, a node is an individual part of a larger data structure.

[Wikipedia: Node (Computer Science)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science))

* Node.js is a cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript.
* Node.js applications are designed to maximize throughput and efficiency, using non-blocking I/O and asynchronous events. It is commonly used for real-time applications due to its asynchronous nature.

##Primitive Data Types

* In computer science, a **primitive data type** can mean either of the following:
	* A **basic type** is a data type provided by a programming language as a basic building block. Most languages allow more complicated composite types to be recursively constructed starting from basic types.
	* A **built-in type** is a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support.

##Headers

* Supplemental data placed at the beginning of a block of data being stored or transmitted.

[Wikipedia: Header (Computing)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(computing))


##Groupings

* In computer science, the term group generally refers to a grouping of users. In principle, users may belong to none, one, or many groups (although in practice some systems place limits on this).
* The primary purpose of user groups is to simplify access control to computer systems.

[Wikipedia: Group (Computing)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(computing))


##SSH

* **Secure Shell (SSH)** is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other secure network services between two networked computers.

[Wikipedia: Secure Shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)


## Subtype

* A datatype that is related to another datatype (the supertype). Program elements written to operate on elements of the supertype can also operate on elements of the subtype.
